# Crying.dev ðŸ˜­

Welcome to Crying.dev, your safe space for developer tears. This project provides a terminal-like interface where developers can log their emotional states, view statistics, and get some virtual support. Because sometimes, you just need to let it all out!

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Log Cry**: Log your emotional state with intensity, reason, and notes. Let the tears flow!
- **View Stats**: View statistics about your emotional journey. See how much you've grown (or cried).
- **Help Command**: Get a list of available commands. Because we all need a little help sometimes.
- **Clear Command**: Clear the terminal. Wipe those tears away.
- **Exit Command**: Try it and find out ðŸ‘€. Spoiler: It doesn't stop the crying.

## Installation ðŸš€

Ensure you have a recent version of [node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed. Because nothing's worse than outdated tools.
